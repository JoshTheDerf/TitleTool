TitleTool
=========

A Java/Python program for creating animated cinematic titles.  Requires Blender 2.66+  Default Titles are in repository TitleTool_TitlePack

# About TitleTool:
TitleTool is a program for generating cinematic animated titles from presets (modifiable by the end-user) with Blender.

# TitleTool Progress:
TitleTool is currently somewhat stable, but needs LOTS of commenting of code, and documentation.
The entire XML and Python API is undocumented, and I really need to write it soon.

# TODO:
* DOCUMENT THE CODE
* Write API Documentation
* Provide well-documented Example Titles (Other than the main TitlePack)
* Provide installation instructions
* Provide compilation instructions
* Make sure all the code is correctly inserted in the repo
* Make lots more titles
* Do good cross-platform te
